    /// the translated string.
    /// 1. The files must use the UTF-8 encoding **WITHOUT A BOM**.
    /// 2. The key, namespace and translated string columns must be separated by commas (0x2c) or semicolons (0x3b). Semicolons
    /// are an Excel specific quirk on many locales. They will parse successfully, but commas are preferred.
    /// 3. The length of the key must be between 1 and 128 **bytes**. That is, be careful when using mutibyte UTF-8 characters
    /// (e.g. CJK).
    /// 4. The length of the namespace must be between 0 (since it's optional) and 128 **bytes**.
    /// 5. The key and the namespace **MUST NOT** conain newlines (0x0a), carriage returns (0x0d), horizontal tabs (0x09) or double
    /// quotes (0x22). Likewise, they shouldn't contain commas (0x2c) or semicolons (0x3b) because they will be interpreted as
    /// column delimiters.
    /// 6. The translated string column must be followed by a newline (0x0a) or a carriage return and a newline (0x0d 0x0a). 
    /// Those symbols indicate the end of the row.
    /// 7. If the translated string contains newlines (0x0a), carriage returns (0x0d), double quotes (0x22) or the delimiters that
    /// were used to separate the columns of this line (either semicolons (0x3b) or commas (0x2c)), it must be delimited by double
    /// quotes (0x22). The first double quote goes directly after the separator that separated the namespace from the translated
    /// string. The second one goes right before the newline (0x0a) or a carriage return and a newline (0x0d 0x0a) that indicate the
    /// end of the row.
    /// 8. The translated string may contain double quotes (0x22). However, each double quote chatacter must be immediately followed
    /// by an another double quote chatacter (0x22), e.g., this is a full line: "Start ""quoted name "" end"
    ///
