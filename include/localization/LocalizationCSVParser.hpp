    /// the translated string.
    /// 1. The files must use the UTF-8 encoding.
    /// 2. The key, namespace and translated string columns must be separated by a tab character.
    /// 3. The length of the key must be between 1 and 128 **bytes**. That is, be careful when using mutibyte UTF-8 characters
    /// (e.g. CJK).
    /// 4. The length of the namespace must be between 0 (since it's optional) and 128 **bytes**.
    /// 5. The key and the namespace **MUST NOT** conain newlines, tabs or regular ASCII double quotes (").
    /// 6. The translated string column must be followed by a newline. It indicates the end of the row.
    /// 7. The translated string may contain tabs or newlines, however, if it does, it must be delimited by double quotes.
    /// The first double quote goes directly after the tab that separated the namespace from the translated string. The second
    /// one goes right before the newline that indicates the end of the row.
    /// 8. The translated string must not contain regular ASCII double quotes ("). Pretty UTF-8 double quotes that are inserted
    /// automatically (usually) by your spreadsheet software are OK.
    /// 
    /// Most of the formatting requirements will be automatically fulfilled by LibreOffice. When saving the csv:
    ///
    /// 1. Set the character set to Unicode (UTF-8)
    /// 2. Set the field delimiter to {Tab}
    /// 3. Set the text delimiter to double quotes ("). Use regular double quotes provided in the drop-down. Do not manually
    /// type in pretty unicode ones.
    /// 4. Check "Save cell content as shown" and uncheck everything else.
    ///
    /// \warning This doesn't work on files exported by excel or Google Docs
    ///

    ///
