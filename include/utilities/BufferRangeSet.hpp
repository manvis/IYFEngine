/// This container is used to keep track of free ranges in data buffers for later reuse. It does not
/// store any pointers to actual data buffers and does not perform any memory management on its own,
/// therefore it can be used for buffers that reside in either RAM or VRAM.
///
/// How to use:
///
/// 1. Call getFreeRange() to request a free range that would fit the specified number of bytes. This
/// may fail because of the fragmentation, so always check your return values.
///
/// 2. Call insert() to return a range that you no longer wish to use back into the set. This will
/// automatically merge touching ranges into a bigger one.
///
/// \warning This container assumes that ranges CANNOT overlap.
/// 
/// \todo Test with zeros (e.g. a vertex only mesh has no need for an ibo and would be submitting
/// 0 sized insert() and getFreeRange() calls).
///
/// \todo Implement defragmentation and perform it once the number of fragments reaches
/// a certain threshold.
///
/// \todo For now, getFreeRange() returns the first interval that can fit the size. How does
/// this affect fragmentation? Would it be better to find the smallest interval that can
/// fully contain the size? The biggest?
